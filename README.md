# istdsa_project---2

We completed the second project as Team-2 in the Data Science Bootcamp of Istanbul Data Science Academy. This is my second project, where I took my first steps into Web Scraping, Regression and Machine Learning.

In this project, which we simply call 'Used Cars Price Prediction', we were asked to develop a machine learning model using linear regression after performing exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on the data we obtained by web scraping. And we decided to scrape our data from arabam.com, a local used car sales website.
